# M03 Programming Assignment 1
## Chapter 20 - 20.11 {Match Grouping Symbols}

A java program contains various pairs of grouping symbols, such as:

- Parentheses: ( and )
- Braces: { and }
- Brackets: \[ and ]

Note the grouping symbols cannot overlap. For example, (a{a)} is illegal.

Write a program to check whether a Java source-code file has correct pairs of grouping symbols. Pass the source-code file name as a command-line argument.
