# M06 Programing Assignment 2
## Chapter 35 - 35.1 {Batch Update}

Write a program that inserts a thousand records to a database, and compare the performance with and without batch updates.

Suppose the table is defined as follows:

```
create a table Temp(num1 double, num2 double, num3 double)
```

Use the Math.random() method to generate random numbers for each record. Create a dialog box that contains DBConnectionPanel. Use this dialog box to connect to the database. When you click the connect to database button, the dialog box is displayed.
